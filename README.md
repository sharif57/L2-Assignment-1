## 5. What is type inference in TypeScript? Why is it helpful?

Type inference in TypeScript is the ability of the compiler to automatically determine the data type of a variable or expression based on its value or how it's used, without explicit type annotations. This helps write more concise code and can improve readability and maintainability by reducing redundancy. 



## 6. How does TypeScript help in improving code quality and project maintainability?

By providing a strong typing system, advanced features, and enhanced readability, TypeScript helps developers write cleaner, more efficient code that is easier to understand and maintain. As a result, projects developed with TypeScript are more likely to be successful, scalable, and maintainable in the long run.
